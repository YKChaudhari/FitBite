                </li>

                <li>
                    <h2>Weight Management:</h2>

                    <h2>Improved Lung Function:</h2>
                    <p>Cardio exercises increase lung capacity and enhance respiratory function. This leads to better

                    <h2>Reduced Stress:</h2>
                    <p>Regular cardiovascular activity is known to reduce stress levels by releasing endorphins, which
                        are natural mood lifters. It also helps in managing and preventing stress-related conditions.

                        reducing the strain on the heart. This is beneficial for overall cardiovascular health.</p>
